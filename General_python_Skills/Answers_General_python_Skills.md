### -Regarding the evaluation, which metrics are you using for the classification problem? Why are you using them and how do you interpret the results? 


### -And for the regression?


### -About the plot. How do you interpret the results? Which kind of relation is shown? Is it enough to take some conclusions or do we need to perform further analysis?
